## Summary

CVE-2025-13932 is a **Broken Access Control** vulnerability in the SolisCloud Monitoring Platform, a cloud-based system widely used to monitor and manage distributed solar and energy assets.

SolisCloud is used globally across residential, commercial, and utility-scale solar deployments, making the underlying access control particularly sensitive in an energy-sector context.

The vulnerability allows an authenticated user to request **arbitrary plant identifiers** via the platform’s cloud APIs and receive **data belonging to other customers**, resulting in cross-tenant exposure of sensitive plant information.

The issue was reported privately, escalated through CERT/CC, and coordinated by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Industrial Control Systems (ICS) team. It is published as **ICSA-25-338-06** and tracked as **CVE-2025-13932**.

## Impact (Per CISA Advisory)

According to the CISA advisory for SolisCloud Monitoring Platform (ICSA-25-338-06), successful exploitation of CVE-2025-13932 can:

- Expose sensitive information associated with monitored plants  
- Allow **cross-tenant access** to data for plants not owned by the authenticated user  
- Provide detailed operational and configuration data useful for reconnaissance and follow-on attacks

CISA assigns the following scores:

- **CVSS v3.1 Base Score:** 7.7 (High)  
  - Vector: `AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N`  
- **CVSS v4.0 Base Score:** 8.3 (High)  
  - Vector: `AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:H/SI:N/SA:N`

The vulnerability is:

- **Network-exploitable**  
- Requires only **low-privilege authentication**  
- Has **low attack complexity**

---

## Technical Description (High-Level)

The SolisCloud Monitoring Platform exposes cloud APIs used to retrieve plant-level data. One of these endpoints accepts a JSON payload containing a plant identifier, for example:

```json
{
  "id": "<plant_id>"
}
```

The backend:

- **Correctly authenticates** the caller, but  
- **Fails to authorize** whether the requested `plant_id` belongs to the authenticated user  

This behaviour allows a low-privileged, authenticated user to:

- Supply a `plant_id` associated with another customer’s plant  
- Receive detailed data for that plant in the response  

This is a classic **Broken Access Control** / **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)** pattern, resulting in **cross-tenant data exposure**.

---

## Reproduction (High-Level Only)

Only minimal steps were taken to confirm the vulnerability:

1. Authenticate to SolisCloud using a standard user account.  
2. Call the relevant plant-detail API endpoint with:  
   - a `plant_id` owned by the authenticated account → returns expected plant data  
   - a `plant_id` not owned by the authenticated account → returns data for another customer’s plant  
3. Confirm that cross-tenant data access occurs.  
4. Stop testing; **no further enumeration** was performed.

No automated scraping, brute forcing of IDs, or attempts to access control functionality were conducted.

---

## Discovery

The vulnerability was discovered accidentally during development of an analytics integration that consumed the SolisCloud API.

During testing, a numeric handling issue in client code caused a plant ID value to be altered before being sent to the API. Instead of returning an error or denying access, the API returned valid data for a **different** plant, demonstrating that:

- The API **trusted the caller’s `plant_id` blindly**, and  
- There was **no server-side check** binding the requested plant data to the authenticated user’s account  

Once cross-tenant access was confirmed, testing was halted and the issue was reported through responsible disclosure channels.

No unauthorized data was retained.

## Vendor Coordination

- **1 September 2025** – Initial report submitted to Solis via support channel  
- Vendor response consisted only of a generic “Declaration of Conformity” PDF, with **no acknowledgement of the vulnerability**  
- **2 September 2025** – CERT/CC and CISA ICS engaged for coordination  
- **September–November 2025** – Multiple attempts were made via coordination channels; vendor did not respond or participate  
- **4 December 2025** – CISA ICS published advisory **ICSA-25-338-06** and CVE-2025-13932 without vendor cooperation
